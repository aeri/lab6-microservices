## Testing microservices life

In order to check that the microservices are working, **traces** of their execution have been obtained and verified, and then it has been verified that they have been correctly registered in Eureka.

### Register microservice

* Trace

As you can see, the microservices are correctly incorporated into the registry:

```
* Web Service screenshot

In the section 'Instances currently registered with Eureka' appears with **UP** status the ACCOUNTS-SERVICE and WEB-SERVICE

## Starting new accounts microservice

While running the previously launched account microservice, the file ```\src\main\resources\application.yml``` is modified by changing Tomcat's HTTP port to 4444.
Another instance of this microservice is executed to be incorporated into the system as a mirror.

* Trace

In the Eureka register trace you can check how this new microservice is correctly incorporated.

```
2020-01-06 19:42:19.721  INFO 9108 --- [nio-1111-exec-4] c.n.e.registry.AbstractInstanceRegistry  : Registered instance ACCOUNTS-SERVICE/localhost:accounts-service:4444 with status UP (replication=false)24416 --- [a-EvictionTimer] c.n.e.registry.AbstractInstanceRegistry

```

* Web Service screenshot

You can now see that the ACCOUNTS-SERVICE application has two registered instances:

## Killing original account microservice

Once the execution of the account microservice that was running on port 2222 has been stopped, you can see how a few seconds later the Eureka service detects an anomaly:

![Accounts Web](images/stop.PNG)

This is indicating that despite not having completely ruled out the existence of the stopped microservice, you may not be able to operate with it.
After attempting to access the Keri user account data from the web microservice, an error 500 is displayed. This will be resolved in subsequent access attempts.

You can see how the new accounts microservice shows the access:
